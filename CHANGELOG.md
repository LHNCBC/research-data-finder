# Change Log

This log documents the significant changes for each release.
This project follows [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## [7.1.0] - 2025-03-12
### Added
- Support for R5 CodeableReference values in tables.
- Support for filtering MedicationDispense and MedicationRequest resources by
  code in the Pull data step.
### Fixed
- Autocomplete for the "code" search parameter for MedicationDispense and
  MedicationRequest resources for R5 servers.
- Autocomplete for the "Observation.code" search parameter to use the "system"
  along with the "code" in the "code:not" query parameters.

## [7.0.5] - 2025-01-23
### Fixed
- An issue with skipping clicks on variables while list is loading.

## [7.0.4] - 2024-12-05
### Fixed
- Improved stability of e2e tests.
- Fixed escaping of FHIR search parameter strings: added backslash escaping.

## [7.0.3] - 2024-11-06
### Fixed
- Checking for an issue with the "not" modifier during initialization might not
  work correctly. The problem appears when a patient for the very first
  Observation in the list only has Observations with the same single code.
- Updating the selected observation codes and data type when changing a variable
  name was performed for all variable values in the advanced criteria, even if
  they were not connected. This resulted in incorrect display of units of
  measurement for variable values.

## [7.0.2] - 2024-10-23
### Changed
- Updated Angular Material to version 17.

## [7.0.1] - 2024-09-09
### Fixed
- An issue where part of a table was not visible when scrolling after it was
  expanded to full screen.
- Removed deprecated RouterTestingModule.
- Replaced legacy Angular Material components.

## [7.0.0] - 2024-07-11
### Added
- Passing a unit system when filtering by observation values. Previously saved
  criteria work as they worked before (but the issue of not being able to pass
  the unit system for an observation value persists because they do not contain
  units of measurement).

## [6.17.9] - 2024-06-27
### Fixed
- Exception when selecting variable values in the cart using autocomplete.

## [6.17.8] - 2024-05-06
### Fixed
- An issue with updating the current value of autocompleter when changing the
  search parameter name (without breaking the loading of saved criteria).
- Added loading possible search parameter values for value sets with the required
  binding strength from the FHIR server. This allows us to display only existing
  values and fixes the fallback used to load values from the server when we can't
  get them from spec definitions.

## [6.17.7] - 2024-04-29
### Changed
- Updated Angular to version 17.
- Updated Angular Material to version 16.
### Fixed
- Styles for autocomplete fields in the cart.

## [6.17.6] - 2024-04-24

### Changed

## [6.17.4] - 2024-04-15
### Added
- An input field to set "max recent Observations per Patient to check" for
  EvidenceVariables.
- "Id", "Status", "Publisher", and "Patient Id" columns to the EvidenceVariable
  table.
- The option to show only unique EvidenceVariables.
### Fixed
- Removing a resource type tab in the pull data step did not stop the loading
  process on this tab or clear the already loaded data.
- Removed duplicate requests for EvidenceVariable.

## [6.17.3] - 2024-04-11
### Fixed
- loadSharedNavLinks.js link from lforms-app.

## [6.17.2] - 2024-03-29
### Changed
- Use shared navigation links from lforms-app.

## [6.17.1] - 2024-03-01
### Fixed
- Issues with tooltips, reading column headers and filter dialogs by a screen
  reader. Also, for sighted users, a column description will be displayed when
  they hover over the info button, and for screen reader users it will be read
  when they click on the button.
- Removed a separate column without a heading for the "Add record to cart" button.

## [6.17.0] - 2024-02-20

  of requests.

  resource types.
